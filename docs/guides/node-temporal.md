summary: "How a node-template node builds recurring and AI workflows on the shared Temporal substrate. The default needs NO node worker: multi-step AI lives inside a LangGraph graph, run on cron by the shared worker; plain crons are routes. A node runs its OWN Temporal worker only for durable, multi-day, human-in-the-loop workflows (the roadmap tier). Includes the beacon walkthrough."

# Building recurring & AI workflows in a node

Temporal is a provisioned substrate ([substrate-temporal.md](https://github.com/cogni-dao/cogni/blob/main/docs/spec/substrate-temporal.md)).
**One shared worker** runs generic workflows and dispatches the work **into your node**.
You almost never run your own worker — you write a **graph** or a **route**.

## Pick your tier

| You're building… | You write… | Needs a node worker? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AI work** (even multi-step: ingest → reason → score → branch) | a **LangGraph graph** in your `graphs/` package | **No** — the graph IS the multi-step composition |
| **plain recurring job** (no AI, e.g. metrics ingest) | a **route** (`defineScheduledJob`) | **No** |
| **durable, multi-day, human-in-the-loop** (approval gates, long waits, cross-crash resume) | a **Temporal workflow** on your **own worker** | **Yes** — see Roadmap |

The first two are the default and the substrate already runs them. The third is the
genuine Temporal-workflow case; it's on the roadmap below.

## Default — AI work is a graph (no worker)

Your multi-step AI flow lives **inside one LangGraph graph** — LangGraph already does steps,
branching, tools, loops. Schedule the graph; the shared worker runs it via `GraphRunWorkflow`,
dispatched into your node's own runtime. Billed + tenant-scoped via `GraphExecutorPort`
(per-user `ExecutionGrant`, RLS). See [langgraph-patterns.md](https://github.com/cogni-dao/cogni/blob/main/docs/spec/langgraph-patterns.md).

```ts
// nodes/<node>/graphs — your node owns this. "300 workflows" = 300 graphs.
export const growthLoop = compileGraph(/* ingest → analyze (LLM) → score → draft (LLM) */);
// then schedule it (cron) → GraphRunWorkflow runs it. No worker, no Temporal code.
```

## Default — plain cron is a route (no worker)

```ts
export const metricsIngest = defineScheduledJob({
  id: "metrics-ingest",
  cron: "*/15 * * * *",
  run: async (ctx) => { /* the work, inline — no route file, no token, no workflow */ },
});
```

### beacon walkthrough (v0)

beacon's growth loop is **one multi-step graph** (`ingest engagement → AI summarize →
score → AI draft`) scheduled on a cron. The shared worker fires it; it runs in beacon;
results land in beacon's DB + Loki. No beacon worker, no Temporal authoring, no operator call.

## Roadmap — human-in-the-loop (generic engine, NO per-node worker)

The moment a workflow must **pause for a human** (approval, review) — slow, inconsistent,
multi-day — a single graph run is the wrong tool (a graph run isn't durable across a crash
or a multi-day wait). But this does **not** require a worker per node.

The target is **one generic durable workflow engine on the shared worker** that interprets a
node-supplied step list — `run graph → await human signal → run graph → branch` — where:

- the **human-wait** (`signal` + `await condition`, durable across days and crashes) is
  generic Temporal mechanics, identical for every node — it lives in the shared worker;
- the **node-specific work** (the AI step, the approval surface) is **dispatched into the
  node** (graph run / route), exactly as today;
- a node defines its HITL workflow as **data** (a step list), not Temporal code — like an
  n8n flow. No node worker, no shared-worker redeploy per workflow.

- **Status:** roadmap, arriving soon (HITL shows up fast).
- A **per-node worker** drops to the genuine last resort — only for arbitrary custom durable
  logic the generic engine's step types can't express. Rare; opt-in.

## Later — AI off the app

When InProc graph load on the node app gets heavy, the LangGraph **Server** executor moves
AI execution to a separate runtime (compute isolation + scale). Same graphs, different
executor. Roadmap.

## The rules (hold inside your node)

- `SCHEDULES_OVER_CRON`, `CRUD_AUTHORITY` (app owns create/pause/delete), `TEMPORAL_DETERMINISM`,
  `ACTIVITY_IDEMPOTENCY` — see [temporal-patterns.md](https://github.com/cogni-dao/cogni/blob/main/docs/spec/temporal-patterns.md).
- AI runs **inside graphs/activities**, never in workflow code.
- Dispatch is at-most-once (`maximumAttempts: 1`) for v0 — make routes idempotent.
